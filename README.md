# CSE6061
CSE6061,Probabilistic inference, Assignment

This is assignment of CSE6061, Inha Univ.
Use FDDB dataset for input.
Output is Precision and Recall from the classified dataset as skin or non-skin.

Following is what I've done.
====================================================================================================

1. Construct a code to classify skin or non-skin based on Bayesian decision
rule by finding a pmf(probability mass function) of likelihood and defining a
prior. Using the trained classifier compute precision and recall. (30pts)
  a. Use R channel values to classify as skin or non-skin
  b. Use all channel(R/G/B) values to classify as skin or non-skin. They
     are NOT necessarily independent!

2. Construct a code to classify skin or non-skin based on pdf for Gaussian
model fitting and Compute precision and recall. (50pts)
  a. Use R channel values to classify as skin or non-skin
  b. Use all channel(R/G/B) values to classify as skin or non-skin. Again,
     they are NOT necessarily independent!

3. Change a prior for skin and non-skin classes and Analyze the result about
above 4 cases(1-a, 1-b, 2-a, 2-b). (20pts)
